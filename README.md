# Welcome to Vanns35's GitHub Profile! ðŸŒŸ

Let's get this show on the road with some fun and quirky facts about me!

Hey there! I'm Vandana Ghadge, a passionate and slightly caffeinated Software Developer with over 5 years of experience in frontend technologies and cloud platforms. When I'm not busy debugging code or optimizing performance, you can find me jamming out to both old classics and the latest hits, finding peace and focus through meditation music, or just trying to keep my plants alive.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on revolutionizing the way we handle single sign-ins with a slick NPM package.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning that plants don't thrive on coffee, but I do! Also diving deeper into TypeScript and Flutter.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that will make my coffee addiction seem like a small price to pay.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with figuring out why my plants are dying (seriously, any tips are welcome).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how I magically turned 30+ minutes of API testing into mere seconds with Postman.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [vanns35.info@gmail.com](mailto:vanns35.info@gmail.com) | +91 8380939065
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Code Whisperer (she/her)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can optimize an application's bundle size by 60% but still can't find matching socks in the morning.
- ðŸŽµ Fun Fact: I unwind with a mix of old and new songs, and daily doses of white noise and meditation music help me sleep and concentrate better.

Welcome to my world of code, coffee, and endless debugging sessions! Feel free to browse around, and let's make something amazing together!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
